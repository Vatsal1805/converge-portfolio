That experience shaped everything. Now we define expectations, map constraints, and document decisions before writing a single line of code. Every hour spent on clarity saves three in execution."

We'd rather lose a billing opportunity than deliver something that works against you. A client who needs us to keep the lights on has been failed by their studio."
